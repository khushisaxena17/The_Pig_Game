# The_Pig_Game
*A fun game created using HTML,CSS,JS.
*It is a game of two players
*Once a player clicks on the roll dice button,the player gets the option either to roll it again or to push the hold button.
*If the player is satisfied with its current score he/she can push the hold button and pass the turn to the opposite player.
*If a '1' falls on the dice, the turn switches to another player.
*But if a player has not pushed the hold and a '1' falls on the dice then all the current score of that player will reset to 0 and the person will lose all its current score.
*Whichever player reaches 100 points wins the game and the game ends.
